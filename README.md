# Assignment-7
This repo contains a readme which describes an R package

Part 1: The package I am talking about is not one I have used very much but I have been meaning to learn it as I think it will simplify and improve my skills at making plots in R. It is the package ggplot2, which is simply a newer version of the package ggplot.

Part 2: How to install the package
There are three ways to install ggplot2. First is to install the Tidyverse since it is part of the suite of packages which make up the tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")
Second is to simply install ggplot2 by itself
install.packages("ggplot2")
Third is to use the development version from GitHub, first you must also install the packaage devtools
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")

Part 3:Vignettes
Since this is such a popular package there are numerous vignettes for it. A quick google search returned multiple pages with vignettes listed.
A trend among them was creating related to the theme and aesthetic portions of the package. These functions govern many of the different plotting options useful for displaying data in clear and useful ways. 

Part 4: Applications
Since this package is part of the Tidyverse it has a dedicated section on the Tidyverse website. This website provides a lot of detail with regard to how the functions contained in the package can be used. It also has a section with 120 extensions to the package with examples of what they do. One reason I feel the need to learn this package is there are more examples on the internet of how to build figures with ggplot than with base R. Thus there are thousands of websites and pages giving examples of how to use this package to produce useful plots. 

Part 5: Review
This package is primarily used for plotting data and developing figures for publications. I like that the package is no more difficult to use or learn that base R plotting, and it uses less code overall to produce similar figures. I also appreciate the amazing amount of support this package has on online resources such as stack overflow and various tutorial websites. It does a great job of being able to produce complex and appealing figures while still maintaining its user friendly functionality when producing exploratory plots. Since I have only used it a few times I only have one complaint so far; I am not a big fan of the grey background that is produced in plots by default. This is a minor complaint however as it can be turned into a transparent background easily. I have found the package to be easy to learn and I am committed to learning to use this in favor of base R. At this point I would reccomend this package to others, it seems to be the standard and I have eoncountered no major downsides with several large upsides.
